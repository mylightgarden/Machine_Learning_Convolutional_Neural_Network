# Machine Learning: Music Genre Classification


## Introduction:

This repo includes step by step source code files for a music genre classification machine-learning project, 
from processing music clips, building a CNN model, predicting based on the save model to creating a GUI application.

The final application allows users to enter a song clip, and receive a formatted top-n list of genres sorted by
confidence value in descending order. The prediction is made by the pre-trained
**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model implemented in TensorFlow. 

By using this program, end users can obtain detailed music genre information, which
may or may not be different from the original genre that the music labeled. Such
information can be refreshing. 



## Major Software Libraries, Languages, APIs, Development Tools:

Language: Python 3
Process Music and Prepare Data for Training: Librosa, OpenCV
Build and Train Model: Tensorflow, Keras
GUI: Python Tkinter, Matplotlib, Pyinstaller



## How to Run the App:

------------------Method 1: --------------

This is the easiest way.

Go to my shared google drive at https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtuNm5NB8oDUkDMQuUsc2I7S_Mes?e=o0EKbD

Double click on the MusicClassification.exe

Note: This .exe file is a standalone executable. It will take some time to load, because the trained model and the environments are packed in it.

If you receive any warnings from your firewall, you are welcome to let your firewall finish the
scan on it. It has no safety threat to your computer.


------------------Method 2: --------------

Open fold 'Tkinter App', then open the GUI.py. You can also open this folder in VSCode and run GUI.py.

This approach may require you to install certain environments, such as tensorflow, if you don't already have them setup.
